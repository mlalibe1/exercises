This CDC data shows statistics about risky behavior among American high school students in categories such as alcohol use, perception of weight and sexual behavior. It’s useful because it provides breakdowns for different subgroups such as gender, race, state and grade, making it easy to compare these groups to the national or state averages and analyze the possibilities for such differences. If comparing states, it could be shown in the form of a map, while a bar graph might be more useful when presenting comparisons between races or genders across the states. https://nccd.cdc.gov/youthonline/App/Results.aspx?TT=&OUT=&SID=HS&QID=H66&LID=&YID=&LID2=&YID2=&COL=&ROW1=&ROW2=&HT=&LCT=&FS=&FR=&FG=&FSL=&FRL=&FGL=&PV=&TST=&C1=&C2=&QP=G&DP=&VA=CI&CS=Y&SYID=&EYID=&SC=&SO=
